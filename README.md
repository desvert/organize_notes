# organize_notes
I created this simple script to help me organize my obsidian folders. It is designed to automate organizing notes into appropriate subdirectories based on common prefixes of the file names to be organized. 

The prefixes and destination directories are contained in a dictionary, which allows for expansion and changes to be made.

By default, the script is intended to be run from the directory containing the files, with the destination files as sub-directories within it.
